# OreGuard

OreGuard is a Factorio 2 mod that protects ore patches from over-building.

## Features

- Prevents building most entities and flooring tiles directly on top of ore patches.
- Allows placement of mining drills, power poles, belts, beacons, pipes, roboports, boxes, and furnaces on ore.
- Returns blocked items to the player's inventory or spills them on the ground if inventory is full.
- Displays a warning message when a build is blocked.

## Whitelisted Entities

- Mining drills
- Electric poles
- Transport belts
- Beacons
- Pipes
- Roboports
- Boxes (containers)
- Furnaces

## Compatibility

- Designed for Factorio 2.0 and above.
- Should be compatible with most other mods, but may conflict with mods that alter tile or entity placement logic.

## Related Mods

There are various mods that fill the map with ore, and restrict what can be built upon it, so as to give an interesting space-constraint game.
This is not that.
OreGuard is designed to prevent factories from spawling over the naturally spawned ore patches, so that your factory must respect the natural resources of the world.
